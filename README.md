# Big Market Sales Prediction 🏪🛒
 Big Market Sales Prediction  This project aims to predict sales for a large retail market based on various influencing factors such as historical sales data, marketing efforts, seasonal trends, and external factors.

Collected data from Kaggle

This is a very simple project, most of the time I did Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization by Python.

I applied Neural Networks technique (ANN) as prediction model, you can try with machine learning algorithms to build prediction model for this project.

Code is easy to understand if you are familiar with machine learning/deep learning by python.

Also, you can play with different parameters in ANN to build more accurate model.

Thanks!
